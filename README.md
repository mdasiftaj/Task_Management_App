---

### ✅ 1. Install dependencies

Open a terminal in the project root folder:

```bash
npm install

# ✅ a. Start Metro Bundler:
npx react-native start

# ✅ b. Run on Android:
npx react-native run-android

# ✅ c. Run on iOS:
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```
### 4.Modifying your App

Now that the app is running, you can start customizing it to fit your needs.

Open the `/src/screens` or `/src/components` folders in your text editor (e.g., VS Code) to modify any screen or UI component. You can also edit `App.tsx` to adjust global settings or navigation.

To see your changes reflected:

- **On Android:** Press `R` twice in the Metro terminal or open the Developer Menu (`Ctrl + M` on Windows/Linux) and tap **"Reload"**.
- **On iOS:** Press `Cmd + R` in the iOS Simulator to reload the app.

✅ Any saved changes will be automatically recompiled and displayed in the emulator or device.


If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

✅ The app will automatically build, install, and launch on your Android emulator or connected device.

👉 Make sure an emulator is running or a real Android device is connected with USB debugging enabled.
